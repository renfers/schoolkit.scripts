Plone scripts in ZMI

Those scripts address a special configuration in the post-obligatory schools of Geneva, where an LDAP connection brings some informations on teachers and students and related groups, like classes.

To take advantage of those informations, we provide webmaster of each school with a set of scripts to be used for instance with PloneFormGen to generate vocabularies for choices or multichoices.
